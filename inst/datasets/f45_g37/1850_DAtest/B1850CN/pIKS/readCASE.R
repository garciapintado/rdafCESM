# CASE description
# this is to conduct a simple test of Green's function and LETKF. The test creates the truth and also creates an m=50 ensemble with a subset of random parameters.
# the random parameters are such that the 1st member is the mean, the np next members are to create single-parameter perturbations, such that Green's function
# calibration can be directly applied with these members. The following m-(np+1) members are such that the required Q covariance of the parameter space is approximately 
# described by the complete ensemble. This should allow a) a simultaneous analysis of a LETKF with all the ensemble, and b) an analysis of a Green-LETKF (to be described
# y Garcia-Pintado et al. 2016)

# the 0 members contains a synthetic 'truth' to test the methods
